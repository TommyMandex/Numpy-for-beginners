# Numpy-for-beginners
NumPy is a Python library that is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It contains a collection of tools and techniques that can be used to solve on a computer mathematical models of problems in Science and Engineering. One of these tools is a high-performance multidimensional array object that is a powerful data structure for efficient computation of arrays and matrices. To work with these arrays, thereâ€™s a vast amount of high-level mathematical functions operate on these matrices and arrays.
